# Vault

The **Vault** is a decentralized storage system designed to unify and manage a user's data across multiple DECTEC platforms (**Twin TV**, **Twin Protocol**, **AIDA**, **IamWellness**)

Each user has a **unique Vault ID**, which serves as their identity key across these platforms. Rather than maintaining separate data stores per platform, the Vault offers a **single and secure location** for storing all relevant assets—such as training data, media files, interaction history, and more.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Integration**  
  Users can **generate** a new Vault ID (refer to Vault Operations/ Create Vault) or **import** (refer to Vault Operations/Import Vault) an existing one across supported platforms to ensure consistent identity and data continuity.

- **User Ownership**  
  The Vault is built with **data sovereignty in mind**. Users have **full control** over their data—they can access, manage, and permanently delete it at any time.

- **Unified Dashboard**  
  A dedicated dashboard allows users to view and manage all data associated with their Vault ID, regardless of the originating platform.
