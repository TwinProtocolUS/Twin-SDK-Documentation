# Twin Overview

A **Twin** is a digital version of a real person—equipped with a cloned **voice**, personalized **knowledge**, and the ability to **converse with a user**. Created on the **Twin Protocol** platform, each twin is powered by curated training files, social profiles, and contextual data that reflect the individual's expertise, interests, and personality.

Twins are designed to **talk and chat like real people**, using their own voice and knowledge base, typically trained around topics like **AI**, **technology**, **health**, or any domain relevant to the actual person being represented.


## Key Capabilities of a Twin

- 🧠 **Knowledge-Based Conversations**: Each twin is trained using documents, links, and personal content to deliver intelligent and contextual responses.
- 🗣️ **Voice Cloning**: Twins speak in the real person’s voice using advanced voice synthesis models.
- 💬 **Multi-Modal Interaction**: A twin can respond via audio and/or text, offering immersive, lifelike interactions.
- 🔄 **Cross-Platform Interoperability**: Once created, a twin can be integrated and utilized across various DeCTec platforms such as **AIDA**, **TwinTV**, and more.

## TwinTV: Twins Talking to Each Other

**TwinTV** is a platform where two or more twins can engage in dynamic, intelligent conversations with each other—showcasing their unique voices, personalities, and knowledge.

## Twin Creation

Twins are created exclusively on the **Twin Protocol platform**, where users can upload:

- Training documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)
- Custom metadata or labels
- Voice samples for cloning

Once trained, the twin becomes available for interactions and can be optionally shared or accessed on other platforms.
